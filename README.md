# Sorting Algorithms Visualized
Sorting algorithms visualized using Python and only matplotlib library for visualization. I did not use matplotlib animation for visualization.
Green - Smaller, Red - Bigger, Orange - Sorted

## Bubble Sort:
This sorting works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

**Time complexity:**  
Best-case: O(n)  
Average-case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
Worst-case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)   

**Space complexity:**  
Worst-case: O(1)  

## Selection Sort:
This sorting works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
In this sorting the cost of swapping is irrelevant, and all elements must be checked. So,

**Time complexity:**  
Same for all cases: O(n<sup>2</sup>)   

**Space complexity:**  
Worst-case: O(1)  

## Insertion Sort:
This sorting works by placing an unsorted element at its suitable place in the sorted part in each iteration.

**Time complexity:**  
Best-case: O(n)  
Average-case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
Worst-case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)   

**Space complexity:**  
Worst-case: O(1)

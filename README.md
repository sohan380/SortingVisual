# Sorting Algorithms Visualized
Sorting algorithms visualized using Python and only matplotlib library for visualization. I did not use matplotlib animation for visualization. I used updating new values with pauses, so it is not suitable for larger data sets.  

**Bubble Sort:**  
This sorting works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
Worst-case time complexity: O(n2)  
Space complexity: O(1)  
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets.
